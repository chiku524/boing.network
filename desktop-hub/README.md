# Boing Network Hub

All-in-one **desktop application** for the Boing Network ecosystem, built with **Tauri 2** (Rust + web frontend). It bundles access to:

- **[Observer](https://boing.observer)** — Block explorer (blocks, accounts, faucet, QA check)
- **Wallet** — Same app as the [boing.express Chrome extension](https://boing.express) (send, stake, dApp connect)
- **[Finance](https://boing.finance)** — DEX & DeFi (swap, liquidity, bridge, portfolio)
- **Testnet** — Testnet ecosystem (register, faucet, quests, developers). Later: general network hub for users.

Users get a single window with a sidebar to switch between these apps, each loaded in an embedded view (iframe) pointing to the live sites. No need to open multiple browser tabs.

**Desktop app experience:** On launch, the app shows a short intro animation (optional “Don’t show intro on next launch”), then checks for updates (with progress if an update is downloading). If the user has not yet dismissed the welcome screen, they see **Sign in**, **Register**, or **Continue without account**; otherwise they go straight to the home dashboard. In the sidebar footer: **Sign in** (when not signed in) opens the welcome screen again; **Sign out** clears session and returns to welcome; **Settings** offers “Show welcome on next launch”, “Show intro on next launch”, and “Check for updates”. The process plugin is used to relaunch the app after an update is installed.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** (or pnpm/yarn)
- **Rust** (latest stable): [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Tauri 2 system deps**: [Tauri — Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

If on Windows you see **"An Application Control policy has blocked this file" (os error 4551)** when running `tauri dev` or `tauri build`, allow Rust/cargo build scripts in your security policy (e.g. Windows Defender Application Control or corporate policy), or run from a path/folder that is not restricted.

## Quick start

```bash
cd desktop-hub
npm install
```

Generate app icons (required for build; use the repo favicon):

```bash
npm run tauri icon public/favicon.svg
```

Run in development:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Outputs (installers and binaries) are under `src-tauri/target/release/` and `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Configuration

Embedded app URLs are set in `src/config.ts` and can be overridden with env vars at build time:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_OBSERVER_URL` | `https://boing.observer` | Observer (block explorer) |
| `VITE_EXPRESS_URL` | `https://boing.express` | Wallet (same as Chrome extension web app) |
| `VITE_FINANCE_URL` | `https://boing.finance` | Finance (DEX) |
| `VITE_NETWORK_URL` | `https://boing.network/testnet` | Testnet ecosystem (later: network hub) |

Example for local/staging:

```bash
VITE_OBSERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000 VITE_EXPRESS_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm run tauri:dev
```

```

## Auto-updates

On first launch the app checks for updates; users can also use **Settings → Check for updates**. If the Tauri updater plugin is installed and an update server is configured, the app shows download progress and restarts after install (using `tauri-plugin-process` for relaunch). To enable updates:

1. Add `tauri-plugin-updater` to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (see [Tauri Updater](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/)) and register it in `lib.rs`.
2. Configure an update server (e.g. GitHub Releases or CrabNebula) and set `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` and endpoints in `tauri.conf.json`.
3. Without the plugin, the check completes immediately and the user proceeds; “Check for updates” does nothing in that case.

## Tech stack

- **Shell**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Desktop**: Tauri 2 (Rust), with `tauri-plugin-shell` (open links) and `tauri-plugin-process` (relaunch after update)
- **Embedded apps**: Loaded via iframe from production (or configured) URLs; no code from observer/express/finance is bundled into the hub

## GitHub Release (CI)

Releases are built and published automatically via GitHub Actions.

### What you need to do once

1. **Workflow permissions**  
   In the repo: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** → select **Read and write permissions** (so the workflow can create the release and upload assets). No extra secrets are required; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by GitHub.

2. **Create the release** (first time or after a new version):
   - **Option A — From a new tag:** Push a tag `desktop-hub/vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `desktop-hub/v0.1.0`). The workflow [release-desktop-hub.yml](../.github/workflows/release-desktop-hub.yml) runs, builds Windows (MSI), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon DMG), and Linux (Debian + AppImage), and creates/updates the GitHub Release with those assets.
   - **Option B — Manual run:** In **Actions → Release Boing Network Hub** → **Run workflow**. This builds from the default branch and publishes to the tag `desktop-hub/v{VERSION}` from `tauri.conf.json` (e.g. `desktop-hub/v0.1.0`). Use this to backfill an existing tag with installers.

3. **Downloads page**  
   [boing.network/downloads](https://boing.network/downloads) uses direct-download URLs to these release assets. If Tauri outputs different filenames, update the `hubDownloads` list in `website/src/pages/downloads.astro`.

### No env vars or secrets needed

The workflow uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only. You do not need to add any repository secrets or environment variables for building or publishing the desktop hub.

## Why Tauri over Electron

- Smaller binaries and lower memory use
- System WebView instead of bundling Chromium
- Rust backend for security and performance
- Same web frontend (React) as the rest of the ecosystem

## License

Same as the Boing Network repository.
