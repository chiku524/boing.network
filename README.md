## Website

The [boing.network](https://boing.network) website lives in `website/`. It's built with Astro and deploys to Cloudflare Pages. See `website/README.md` and [docs/WEBSITE-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/WEBSITE-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md) for setup and deployment.

## Priorities

Security → Scalability → Decentralization → Authenticity → Transparency → **True quality assurance** (protocol-enforced QA: only quality assets on-chain; automation + community pool for edge cases; leniency for meme culture; no malice). See [BOING-NETWORK-ESSENTIALS.md](docs/BOING-NETWORK-ESSENTIALS.md) and [QUALITY-ASSURANCE-NETWORK.md](docs/QUALITY-ASSURANCE-NETWORK.md).
