## Network essentials (six pillars)

The network prioritizes, in order: **1. Security** → **2. Scalability** → **3. Decentralization** → **4. Authenticity** → **5. Transparency** → **6. True quality assurance**. For the full description of each pillar and design philosophy, see [BOING-NETWORK-ESSENTIALS.md](BOING-NETWORK-ESSENTIALS.md).

## 1. Node Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust:** 1.70+ (`rustup` recommended)
- **OS:** Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL recommended on Windows)

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Directory Layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `target/release/boing-node` | Node binary |
| `target/release/boing` | CLI binary |
| `~/.boing/` or `./data/` | Data directory (when using `--data-dir`) |

---

## 2. Running a Node

### Full Node (non-validator)

```bash
cargo run -p boing-node
```

Defaults: RPC on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

### Validator Node

```bash
cargo run -p boing-node -- --validator --rpc-port 8545
```

Produces blocks when there are pending transactions.

### With Data Directory

```bash
cargo run -p boing-node -- --data-dir ./boing-data --rpc-port 8545
```

```

### Logs

Set `RUST_LOG` before running:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p boing-node
# Debug: RUST_LOG=debug
# Trace: RUST_LOG=trace
```

## 6. Incident Response

For security incidents and vulnerabilities:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. **Detect** | Monitor logs, alerts, community reports. |
| 2. **Assess** | Classify severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical. |
| 3. **Contain** | Isolate affected systems; pause if necessary. |
| 4. **Communicate** | Notify validators, users, ecosystem per severity. |
| 5. **Remediate** | Apply fixes; coordinate upgrades via governance if needed. |
| 6. **Post-mortem** | Document cause, impact, and prevention. |

**Contacts:** See [SECURITY-STANDARDS.md](SECURITY-STANDARDS.md) for audit and bug bounty details.

## 6b. Scalability Characteristics

- **Block time:** ~2 seconds (configurable via tokenomics)
- **Throughput:** Parallel transfer batches; access-list batching reduces conflicts
- **Gas:** Fixed per tx type (Transfer, Bond, Unbond, ContractCall, ContractDeploy)
- **Batching:** Scheduler groups non-conflicting txs; transfers with disjoint access lists run in parallel

## 6c. Decentralization Design

- **Permissionless validation:** No whitelist; anyone with stake can validate
- **P2P discovery:** Bootnodes for bootstrap; mDNS for LAN; DHT (roadmap) for discovery
- **No central gatekeeper:** Consensus, governance, and QA pool are decentralized
- **Single-client today:** Multiple implementations encouraged for resilience

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Node won't start

1. Ensure port 8545 (or `--rpc-port`) is free.
2. Check `RUST_LOG=debug` for errors.
3. On Windows: ensure no firewall blocking; try WSL if TCP binding fails.

### Transaction not included

- Validator mode must be enabled for block production.
- Check mempool size and nonce ordering.
- Simulate first: `boing_simulateTransaction` to validate.
- **Note:** If block production or consensus fails, transactions are re-inserted into the mempool automatically so they can be retried in the next round.

### RPC returns "Method not found"

- Ensure you're using the exact method name (case-sensitive).
- Params must be a JSON array (e.g. `"params": []` not `"params": {}`).

### Build fails

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
```

## 8. Testnet Operations

When running the **public incentivized testnet**, the following operations keep bootnodes and the faucet available. See [TESTNET.md](TESTNET.md) Part 3 for the full launch checklist.

### 8.1 Running a bootnode

A **bootnode** is a node with a stable, publicly reachable address that other nodes use to join the network.

1. **Build:** `cargo build --release`
2. **Run with P2P and a fixed port:**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/boing-node \
     --p2p_listen /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001 \
     --validator \
     --rpc-port 8545 \
     --data-dir ./bootnode-data
   ```
3. **Publish the multiaddr:** Your bootnode address is `/ip4/<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/tcp/4001`. Ensure TCP port 4001 (and 8545 if RPC is public) is open in the firewall. Add this multiaddr to [TESTNET.md](TESTNET.md) §6 and to `website/src/config/testnet.ts` (or set `PUBLIC_BOOTNODES` at build time).
4. **Recommendation:** Run at least **two** bootnodes on different hosts for redundancy.

### 8.2 Running the faucet node

The **faucet** is an RPC method (`boing_faucetRequest`) on a node started with `--faucet-enable`. Use a dedicated node (or a node behind your public RPC) so the website faucet page can target it.

1. **Build:** `cargo build --release`
2. **Run with faucet enabled:**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/boing-node \
     --validator \
     --faucet-enable \
     --rpc-port 8545 \
     --data-dir ./faucet-data
   ```
   For the **public testnet**, also use `--p2p_listen` and `--bootnodes` so this node syncs with the network.
3. **Publish the RPC URL:** Point users and the website to this node’s RPC (e.g. `https://testnet-rpc.boing.network/`). Set `PUBLIC_TESTNET_RPC_URL` when building the website so the faucet page defaults to this URL.
4. **Rate limit:** The faucet allows 1 request per 60 seconds per account; no extra config needed.
5. **Genesis:** The faucet account is funded at genesis with 10,000,000 testnet BOING (see `boing-node/src/faucet.rs`). Ensure all testnet nodes use the same genesis so the faucet balance exists.

### 8.3 Cloudflare Tunnel (testnet-rpc.boing.network)

For full setup steps, see [INFRASTRUCTURE-SETUP.md](INFRASTRUCTURE-SETUP.md). If you use Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the RPC at `https://testnet-rpc.boing.network/`:

- **"Failed to initialize DNS local resolver"** — This cloudflared log message is usually harmless. The tunnel has already registered; traffic forwarding works. It occurs when cloudflared cannot reach `region1.v2.argotunnel.com` for optional region/metrics. You can ignore it. If it bothers you, try a different DNS (e.g. 1.1.1.1) or firewall rules that allow outbound DNS.

### 8.4 Monitoring the testnet

- **Chain height:** Call `boing_chainHeight` on the public RPC periodically; alert if growth stalls.
- **Faucet balance:** Check the faucet account balance via `boing_getBalance` with the faucet account ID; refill or alert when low (genesis funding is 10M; 1,000 per request).
- **Bootnode reachability:** Ensure ports 4001 (P2P) and 8545 (RPC, if exposed) are reachable from the internet; use a simple TCP check or your monitoring stack.

### 8.5 Log: `P2P: block publish error: InsufficientPeers` (Gossipsub)

**What it means:** libp2p Gossipsub only forwards a published message to peers that have **advertised subscription** to the topic (`boing/blocks` / `boing/transactions`). Right after startup—or on very small networks—there can be a **short window** where you are connected (or still dialing) but **no peer is in `topic_peers` yet**, so `publish` returns `InsufficientPeers`.

**What is *not* broken:** Local consensus already **committed** the block (you will see `Consensus: committed block` in the same trace). JSON-RPC, faucet, and wallet balance use the node’s local chain, not Gossipsub.

**Propagation:** Other nodes can still obtain blocks via the **block request/response** protocol (`/boing/block-sync/1`) once they are connected; Gossipsub is an optimization for fan-out, not the only sync path.

**If the second node never catches up:** Check bootnode multiaddrs, firewall **TCP 4001**, matching genesis, and that both sides run a build with the same network ID / chain config—not this warning alone.

### 8.6 “Smart contracts”, boing.finance, and Boing devnet

**Boing L1 today is not an EVM chain.** Execution uses the **Boing VM** (stack machine + opcodes in `crates/boing-execution`, bytecode QA in `boing-qa`). Contracts are deployed with on-chain **`ContractDeploy`** / called with **`ContractCall`** payloads inside Boing `Transaction`s, submitted as `boing_submitTransaction` (see `docs/RPC-API-SPEC.md`). There is **no** deployed `dexRouter` / `UniswapV2Factory` style **Solidity** surface on Boing testnet for **boing.finance** to talk to; that app’s **chain 6913** entries in `contracts.js` are placeholders (`0x000…`).

**To get on-chain programs on devnet:**

1. **Author bytecode** accepted by the protocol QA gate (see `docs/QUALITY-ASSURANCE-NETWORK.md` and mempool/RPC QA checks).
2. **Build and sign** a `ContractDeploy` transaction with the Boing signing model (BLAKE3 + Ed25519 + bincode), or use tooling that outputs `boing_submitTransaction`-compatible hex (CLI/SDK as they mature).
3. **Run nodes** with the same genesis and peer connectivity so blocks (and deploy txs) propagate.

**To make boing.finance Swap / Deploy Token / pools work “on Boing”** you would need either: **(a)** a **separate EVM-compatible chain** (or rollup) with real factory/router addresses wired into `contracts.js`, or **(b)** a **large product effort** to implement Boing-native DEX logic against Boing RPC and the custom VM—not just filling `6913` with addresses on current Boing L1.
