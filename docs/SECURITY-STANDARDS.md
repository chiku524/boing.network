## 1. Protocol-Level Security

### 1.1 Consensus (HotStuff BFT + PoS)

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** | Network operates correctly with up to 1/3 malicious validators | ✓ HotStuff |
| **PoS + Slashing** | Validators stake BOING; malicious behavior penalized | ✓ Implemented |
| **VRF Leader Selection** | Unpredictable, unbiased leader election | Design / Roadmap |
| **Equivocation Detection** | Double-signing detected and slashed | ✓ Consensus |

### 1.2 Cryptography

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Audited Primitives** | Ed25519 signatures, BLAKE3 hashing | ✓ In use |
| **Secure Key Management** | HD wallets, multi-sig for critical ops | Roadmap |
| **Post-Quantum** | Investigate quantum-resistant algorithms for long-term integrity | Research target |

### 1.3 Smart Contract Security (Rust VM)

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Memory Safety** | Rust prevents buffer overflows, null derefs | ✓ Core in Rust |
| **Formal Verification** | Mathematical proof for critical contracts (staking, DeFi, automation) | Roadmap |
| **Continuous Audits** | Independent audits of core protocol and contracts | Roadmap |

### 1.4 State Management (Verkle Trees)

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Data Integrity** | Verkle trees for compact proofs; smaller, verifiable state | ✓ Sparse Merkle |
| **Stateless Clients** | More participants can validate without full state | ✓ Proof APIs |

---

## 2. Network-Level Security

### 2.1 P2P Layer

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Decentralized Bootstrapping** | DHT + gossip-first; bootnode rotation | Roadmap |
| **Encrypted Transport** | Noise over TCP/QUIC (libp2p) | ✓ libp2p |
| **DDoS Resistance** | Rate-limiting, peer scoring, connection management | Partial (PeerScore) |
| **Sybil / Eclipse Mitigation** | Reputation, stake requirements, diverse connections | Roadmap |

### 2.2 Client Diversity

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multiple Implementations** | Encourage independent clients (different languages/teams) |
| **Rationale** | Single client bug cannot compromise entire network |

---

## 3. Application-Level Security

### 3.1 Boing SDK

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Secure Defaults** | Guide developers toward secure patterns |
| **Integrated Security Tools** | Static analysis, vulnerability scanning, testing |
| **Human-Readable Signing** | Users understand what they authorize |

### 3.2 Decentralized Automation

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **ZKPs / Fraud Proofs** | Verify off-chain execution | Design in AUTOMATION-VERIFICATION |
| **Decentralized Oracles** | External data via decentralized oracle networks | Roadmap |
| **Executor Incentives & Slashing** | Economic alignment for honest execution | ✓ ExecutorIncentive |

### 3.3 User-Facing Security

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Account Abstraction** | Smart-contract wallets; MFA, limits, spending policies |
| **Social Recovery** | Recovery without single seed phrase; guardians, time locks |

---

## 4. Operational Security & Governance

### 4.1 Audits & Bug Bounties

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Continuous Audits** | Multiple independent firms; core protocol and new features |
| **Bug Bounty Program** | Generous rewards for responsible disclosure |
| **Scope** | Consensus, execution, automation, bridges |

### 4.2 Governance

| Measure | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Phased Upgrades** | Proposal → Cooling → Execution | ✓ boing-governance |
| **Community Vetting** | Security-critical changes reviewed by community |
| **No Central Control** | Parameter and upgrade control decentralized |

### 4.3 Transparency & Incident Response

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Public security posture, audit reports, incidents |
| **Incident Response Plan** | Clear, tested process for vulnerabilities and attacks |
| **Communication** | Fast, accurate disclosure to users and ecosystem |

---

## 5. Security Contacts

| Channel | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Security advisories** | [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/chiku524/boing.network/security/advisories/new) — for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities |
| **Bug bounty** | *TBD — program to be announced with incentivized testnet* |
| **Incident response** | See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) §6; severity-driven communication |

**For vulnerabilities:** Please report via GitHub Security Advisories. Do not open public issues for security-sensitive findings.
