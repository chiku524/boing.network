## Shared answers (copy-paste for either form)

### Product stage

**MVP / Prototype / Proof of Concept**

*Rationale: Boing has a working node binary, consensus (HotStuff), P2P (libp2p), CLI (`boing init`, `boing dev`, `boing deploy`), SDK (TypeScript), testnet infrastructure (bootnodes, faucet), and comprehensive documentation. The protocol is functional but not yet at mainnet.*

### Ecosystem

**My own network (Boing.Network)** — optional to add: bridged liquidity and routing (via boing.finance).

### Elevator pitch (75 words or less)

Boing Network is an authentic L1 blockchain built from first principles with protocol-enforced quality assurance. We are the first chain where only deployments meeting defined security and compliance rules are accepted on-chain—reducing scams, congestion, and low-value spam. Combined with native account abstraction, adaptive gas, and 100% transparent tokenomics, we are building infrastructure for a sustainable, scam-resistant DeFi ecosystem. Testnet live; SDK and CLI ready.

### Problem (200 words max)

Most L1 blockchains allow any bytecode to be deployed. Users and protocols bear the risk of malicious or low-quality deployments, with no protocol-level protection. When anything can be deployed, chains become clogged with low-value or spam transactions—driving up fees and degrading UX for legitimate users. Liquidity is fragmented across dozens of chains; cross-chain coordination is trust-heavy and complex. Many networks lack verifiable transparency in tokenomics, treasury, and upgrades. Reward cliffs and unchecked inflation undermine long-term viability. These problems matter because they erode trust, waste resources, and slow mainstream adoption. Users lose funds to scams; developers face hostile environments; and validators operate in opaque ecosystems. A chain that enforces quality at the protocol layer—while remaining transparent and sustainable—directly addresses these pain points and creates a foundation for responsible DeFi growth.

### Solution (200 words max)

Boing introduces protocol-enforced quality assurance: the first L1 where only deployments meeting defined rules (bytecode checks, security heuristics, purpose declaration) are accepted. This reduces network congestion by keeping mempools and blocks focused on legitimate, high-quality transactions instead of spam. Automation handles known cases; a community QA pool handles edge cases, with leniency for meme culture and zero tolerance for malice. We combine QA with native account abstraction (gasless UX, social recovery, session keys at the protocol level), an adaptive gas model (dynamic pricing with predictable caps), and cross-chain DeFi coordination via light clients and boing.finance. Phased governance uses time-locked proposals—no surprise upgrades. Tokenomics are sustainable: uncapped supply with floor-triggered waves and no reward cliffs. The core protocol (consensus, execution, state, P2P) is implemented in Rust; developer tools include `boing init`, `boing dev`, `boing deploy`, and a TypeScript SDK. Testnet is live with bootnodes and faucet.

### Competition & advantage (200 words max)

Existing L1s generally permit any bytecode deployment. Quality assurance, when it exists, is application- or contract-layer—not protocol-enforced. No major L1 today filters deployments at consensus or execution layers. Boing’s advantage is protocol QA: only assets meeting defined rules reach the chain. This is not a dApp feature; it is infrastructure. We reduce congestion and scam risk at the source. No other L1 enforces deployment standards at the protocol layer. We add 100% transparency (open specs, auditable tokenomics), a custom stack (Rust, HotStuff BFT, libp2p), and sustainable tokenomics (floor-triggered waves, no cliffs). We are independent of other chains—our own architecture, not a fork. Ecosystem integration via boing.finance provides cross-chain DeFi coordination. Developer tooling (CLI, SDK) and success-based dApp incentives are built in. We are uniquely positioned to serve users and protocols seeking a scam-resistant, congestion-aware L1.

### Target market & size (200 words max)

**Primary:** DeFi users, protocols, and validators seeking a scam-resistant L1 with transparent governance and sustainable incentives. **Secondary:** Developers building on a quality-assured chain. **Market size:** Global DeFi TVL exceeds $50B across hundreds of chains. Millions of users and thousands of protocols face scam and congestion risk daily. We target early adopters: security-conscious protocols, validators tired of opaque ecosystems, and users burned by scams. Long-term, we aim for DeFi protocols that require compliance or quality standards. TAM includes the intersection of DeFi, quality-conscious institutions, and cross-chain liquidity—a growing segment as regulation and user expectations evolve.

### Go-to-market (200 words max)

**Phase 1—Testnet:** Public testnet with bootnodes, faucet, and RPC. Developer docs, CLI, SDK, and one-click validator integration (VibeMiner). Incentivized testnet (2–4 weeks) rewards validators, developers, and users—qualifying participants for mainnet recognition. **Phase 2—Mainnet:** Security audits, formal verification, infrastructure hardening. Validator bootstrap via early incentives and hardware grants (capped). Developer grants and hackathons. boing.finance integration for cross-chain swap, bridge, and liquidity routing. **Phase 3—Ecosystem:** Success-based dApp incentives with per-dApp caps; community QA pool; governance-driven parameter evolution. Messaging: “Only quality assets on-chain. No other L1 enforces deployment standards at the protocol layer.” Channels: GitHub, Discord, docs, accelerator/VC outreach.

### How you generate value (200 words max)

BOING tokens are used for staking, governance, fees, and validator incentives. Fee split: 70–80% to validators, 20–30% to treasury. Usage drives fee revenue; validators and treasury earn from transactions. Floor-triggered waves restore balance when circulating supply reaches a floor—no reward cliffs. Transaction fees flow to validators and treasury. Treasury funds audits, grants, ecosystem growth, and infrastructure. dApp incentives (success-based, per-dApp capped) align developer success with network adoption. Cross-chain DeFi via boing.finance captures value from swap fees and liquidity. At maturity, fee revenue dominates over emissions. Emissions decline over time (Year 1 ~8%, Year 10+ targets 1% floor or 0% if fees sufficient).

### Validation steps (200 words max)

**Technical:** Core protocol implemented—consensus (HotStuff), execution (custom VM), state (Sparse Merkle), P2P (libp2p). Node binary runs in single- and multi-node modes. Developer tools (CLI, SDK) scaffold and deploy dApps. Protocol QA design includes opcode whitelist, blocklist, scam patterns; community pool for edge cases. Build and tests pass; fuzz harness for primitives. **Operational:** Testnet infrastructure designed—bootnodes, faucet, public RPC. Documentation (RUNBOOK, RPC-API-SPEC, TESTNET, READINESS) supports validators and developers. boing.network site live with docs, faucet, and investor materials. **Market:** Design aligns with user pain (scams, congestion, opacity). Six-pillar philosophy documented. Tokenomics and governance designed for sustainability. Incentivized testnet plan ([TESTNET.md](TESTNET.md) Part 3) outlines validator/developer incentives. Next: bootnode launch, public testnet, early validator/developer feedback.

## Optional questions (max 1,000 characters per answer)

Use these for application forms that ask the three optional questions below. Replace **[YOU FILL]** placeholders (your background, start date) before submitting.

### 1. How do you know you can ship this product?

**Draft (≈980 characters):**

The core protocol is written and maintained by the founding team. Full codebase: **https://github.com/chiku524/boing.network** — Rust workspace (consensus, execution, state, P2P, CLI, node). We have shipped a working L1 stack from first principles: HotStuff BFT consensus, custom VM, libp2p networking, CLI (`boing init`, `boing dev`, `boing deploy`), TypeScript SDK, testnet with bootnodes and faucet, and docs (technical spec, runbook, testnet guide). **[YOU FILL: e.g. I/we have X years in distributed systems / web3 / Rust; previous roles at [companies]; built [prior products].]** **[YOU FILL: Outcome of previous companies or projects—e.g. shipped to production, users/revenue, acquisition, or open-source adoption.]** We are a small technical team that has already delivered an MVP; the roadmap (BUILD-ROADMAP.md) and READINESS checklist show what’s done and what’s next. We can ship because we have already built the hardest parts—consensus, execution, and protocol QA design—and we iterate in the open.

---

### 2. What problem are you solving? And why is it valuable?

**Draft (≈990 characters):**

**To a friend:** We’re building a blockchain where only quality, rule-compliant deployments are allowed on-chain—so fewer scams and less spam. **Ideal customer:** DeFi users and protocols who have lost trust (or funds) to malicious deployments, and validators who want transparent, sustainable incentives. **The one problem they’re desperate to solve:** “I want to use/build on a chain that doesn’t let every scam and spam contract onto the network.” **Unique insight from users:** People don’t want more filters inside apps—they want the chain itself to enforce a bar. Protocol-level QA shifts the burden from every dApp to the infrastructure. **Why now:** Regulatory and user expectations are rising; congestion and scam fatigue are acute on major L1s. Technology (efficient consensus, programmable execution, light clients) makes a quality-assured L1 feasible. We’re the first to enforce deployment standards at the protocol layer—no other L1 does this—so the timing and differentiation are clear.

---

### 3. Tell us about your progress.

**Required: Month and year started:** **[YOU FILL — e.g. March 2024 or January 2025]**

**Draft (≈970 characters):**

**Most important metric:** Protocol completeness and testnet readiness (nodes running, RPC, faucet, docs). **Progress:** Core protocol implemented: consensus (HotStuff), execution (custom VM), state (Sparse Merkle), P2P (libp2p). Node binary runs in single- and multi-node modes; CLI and TypeScript SDK support init, dev, and deploy. Testnet infrastructure is in place (bootnodes, faucet, public RPC at testnet-rpc.boing.network). Explorer (boing.observer) and wallet (boing.express) exist. Full documentation (specs, RUNBOOK, TESTNET, READINESS) supports validators and developers. **How we make money:** BOING is used for staking, governance, and fees; 70–80% of fees go to validators, 20–30% to treasury. Treasury funds audits, grants, and ecosystem growth. Cross-chain DeFi via boing.finance will generate swap/liquidity fees. **Users:** Testnet phase—early validators and developers; user counts will grow with incentivized testnet and mainnet launch. We are at MVP stage with a live testnet and clear path to mainnet.

### Complete project blurb

Boing Network is an authentic L1 blockchain built from first principles with **protocol-enforced quality assurance**: the first chain where only deployments meeting defined security and compliance rules are accepted on-chain. This reduces scams, congestion, and low-value spam at the source—not via app-level filters but at the protocol layer. We combine this with native account abstraction, adaptive gas, 100% transparent tokenomics, and cross-chain DeFi coordination (boing.finance). The stack is implemented in Rust (consensus: HotStuff BFT; execution: custom VM; networking: libp2p). Developer tools include the CLI (`boing init`, `boing dev`, `boing deploy`) and a TypeScript SDK. Testnet is live with bootnodes, faucet, and public RPC; explorer (boing.observer) and wallet (boing.express) are available. We are building infrastructure for a sustainable, scam-resistant DeFi ecosystem.

|--------|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Yes | We plan a mainnet token launch (TGE) at or after mainnet. |
| **B** | No | We will not have a public token (rare for an L1). |
| **C** | Token is already live! | Only if BOING is already live on **mainnet** (testnet doesn’t count). |
| **D** | Undecided | Timing/format not yet fixed; will decide with advisors/accelerator. |

*For Boing: **A (Yes)** or **D (Undecided)** are the usual choices—BOING is the native chain token; testnet BOING exists; mainnet TGE would be at/after mainnet launch.*

---

### What is your TGE plan?

**Draft (copy-paste and edit as needed):**

BOING is the native token of Boing Network (staking, governance, fees). Testnet BOING is live for faucet and validator testing. **Mainnet TGE** is planned at or shortly after mainnet launch: initial distribution aligned with our tokenomics (emission, validator rewards, treasury, community/ecosystem). We will follow a phased approach—incentivized testnet participants may qualify for mainnet recognition per our READINESS and TESTNET docs—and will ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Exact date and mechanics will be set after security audits and mainnet readiness; we are open to accelerator/advisor input on timing and structure.

*Short version (if character limit):*  
*BOING is the native token; testnet live. Mainnet TGE at or after mainnet launch, with distribution per tokenomics and compliance. Timing to be finalized post-audits and with accelerator/advisor input.*
