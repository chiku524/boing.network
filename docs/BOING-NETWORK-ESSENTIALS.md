# Boing Network — Essentials

> **One place for the essentials of the Boing blockchain network:** the six pillars, design philosophy, priorities, tech stack, and pointers to the rest of the docs.

---

## What Is Boing Network?

**Boing Network** is an authentic, decentralized **L1 blockchain** built from first principles. It is optimized for efficiency, free from dependencies on other chains, and committed to **100% transparency** and **true quality assurance** at the protocol layer. This document summarizes the core commitments and where to go for detail.

## The Six Pillars

The Boing blockchain prioritizes, in order:

| # | Pillar | What it means |
|---|--------|----------------|
| **1** | **Security** | Safety and correctness over speed. |
| **2** | **Scalability** | Throughput and efficient resource use. |
| **3** | **Decentralization** | Permissionless participation at every layer. |
| **4** | **Authenticity** | Unique architecture and identity (not a fork or framework). |
| **5** | **Transparency** | 100% openness in design, governance, and operations — the foundation for community trust. |
| **6** | **True quality assurance** | Top-notch standards with built-in automation: only assets that meet protocol-defined rules and security bar are allowed on-chain. All currently known edge cases are resolved by the automated regulatory QA system (Allow or Reject); **leniency for meme culture** (meme/community/entertainment are valid purposes), with **no maliciousness or malignancy** allowed. The community QA pool is only for genuinely unknown or policy-mandated cases. See [QUALITY-ASSURANCE-NETWORK.md](QUALITY-ASSURANCE-NETWORK.md). |

## Design Philosophy

- **Authentic** — Our own architecture, not a fork or framework.
- **Independent** — Zero reliance on Solana, Cosmos, Ethereum, or other chains.
- **Optimal** — Adopt the best ideas from the ecosystem when they are demonstrably superior.
- **Unique** — A distinct identity and technical story.
- **Decentralized** — Absolute decentralization as a foundational requirement.
- **Transparent** — 100% transparent in how we build, govern, and operate — trust through verifiability, not promises.

## Priorities (Order of Precedence)

When trade-offs arise, the network applies this order:

1. **Security** → 2. **Scalability** → 3. **Decentralization** → 4. **Authenticity** → 5. **Transparency** → 6. **True quality assurance**

## Tech Stack at a Glance

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Language** | Rust |
| **Hashing** | BLAKE3 |
| **Signatures** | Ed25519 |
| **Consensus** | PoS + HotStuff BFT |
| **State** | Sparse Merkle tree (Verkle target) |
| **Execution** | Custom VM (stack-based; opcodes inspired by EVM, simplified) |
| **Networking** | libp2p (TCP, Noise, gossipsub, request-response) |
| **Governance** | Phased (proposal → cooling → execution); time-locked |

## Transparency Commitment

We commit to 100% transparency in:

- **Protocol design** — Open design docs, public specs, auditable code.
- **Tokenomics** — Emission, fee splits, burn — on-chain and documented.
- **Governance** — On-chain proposals, votes, outcomes.
- **Validator & staking** — Clear slashing, reward formulas, distribution.
- **Security & audits** — Audit reports public; known risks disclosed.
- **Development** — Open source; roadmap and trade-offs discussed openly.
